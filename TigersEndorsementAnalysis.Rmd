This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook created as a capstone project for the Coursera Data Analytics Google Professional Certificate. It is a hypothetical project wherein an athletics wear company has tasked me with selecting a baseball player form the Detroit Tigers to offer an endorsement. 

This will be done by evaluating players statistical performance via their OPS or On-Base Percentage. A higher OPS indicates better batting, and a better candidate for endorsement. Consistency will also be taken into account. For this, we will examine players' OPS over 3 seasons. 

Statistics from [baseball-reference.com](https://www.baseball-reference.com/) will be used to select the player with best OPS over three seasons for endorsement.

```{r}
DET2021 <- read.csv("DET_Batting_2021sportsref_download.xls.csv")
DET2022 <- read.csv("DET_Batting_2022sportsref_download.xls.csv")
DET2023 <- read.csv("DET2023_Batting_sportsref_download.xls.csv")
```
```{r}
head(DET2021)
```
```{r}
head(DET2022)
DET2022$Name <- iconv(DET2022$Name, from = "UTF-8", to = "ASCII//TRANSLIT")

```
```{r}
head(DET2023)
DET2023$Name <- iconv(DET2023$Name, from = "UTF-8", to = "ASCII//TRANSLIT")
```
In baseball statistics, known as sabermetrics, On-base plus slugging is calculated by adding a batter's on base percentage to their slugging percentage. The former is an average of how often a player gets on base per at bat. The latter is the quotient of the total number of bases a player achieves per total at bats. [@Wikipedia(OPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging) 

Let's remove any null values from the OPS columns in our data frames: 
```{r}
DET2021 <- DET2021 %>% drop_na(OPS)
DET2022 <- DET2022 %>% drop_na(OPS)
DET2023 <- DET2023 %>% drop_na(OPS)
```
Next remove any non-player names and pitcher Mathew Boyd's(since he is not a hitter his OPS is invalid for these purposes) name from the names columns:
```{r}
DET2021 <- DET2021 %>% filter(!Name %in% c("Team Totals", "Rank in 15 AL teams", "Non-Pitcher Totals", "Pitcher Totals"))
DET2022 <- DET2022 %>% filter(!Name %in% c("Team Totals", "Rank in 15 AL teams", "Non-Pitcher Totals", "Pitcher Totals"))
DET2023 <- DET2023 %>% filter(!Name %in% c("Team Totals", "Rank in 15 AL teams", "Non-Pitcher Totals", "Pitcher Totals"))
DET2021 <- DET2021 %>%
  filter(Name != "Matthew Boyd")
DET2022 <- DET2022 %>%
  filter(Name != "Matthew Boyd")
DET2023 <- DET2023 %>%
  filter(Name != "Matthew Boyd")
```


Lets look at the Tigers with the ten highest OPS in 2023:



```{r}
top_players <- DET2023 %>%
  arrange(desc(OPS)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10)

ggplot(top_players, aes(x = reorder(Name, OPS), y = OPS)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Players by OPS in DET2023",
       x = "Player",
       y = "OPS") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```


Heres a more precise look:
```{r}
combined_data <- bind_rows(
  DET2021 %>% mutate(year = 2021),
  DET2022 %>% mutate(year = 2022),
  DET2023 %>% mutate(year = 2023)
)

combined_data$Name <- iconv(combined_data$Name, from = "UTF-8", to = "ASCII//TRANSLIT")

top_players_table <- DET2023 %>%
  arrange(desc(OPS)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10) %>%
  select(Name, OPS)

print(top_players_table)

```
Now let's look at 2022:
```{r}
top_players_table <- DET2022 %>%
  arrange(desc(OPS)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10) %>%
  select(Name, OPS)
DET2022 <- DET2022 %>%
  filter(Name != "Matthew Boyd")
combined_data$Name <- iconv(combined_data$Name, from = "UTF-8", to = "ASCII//TRANSLIT")

print(top_players_table)
```
And 2021:
```{r}
top_players_table <- DET2021 %>%
  arrange(desc(OPS)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10) %>%
  select(Name, OPS)
DET2021 <- DET2021 %>%
  filter(Name != "Matthew Boyd*")
combined_data$Name <- iconv(combined_data$Name, from = "UTF-8", to = "ASCII//TRANSLIT")

print(top_players_table)
```
A good candidate for endorsement will not only have a high OPS in 2023, but show a consistently high OPS across all three years. This is a good indicator that the player will continue to perform at a high level in the future. So, let's find player's average OPS from 2021, 2022, and 2023.
```{r}

combined_data <- bind_rows(
  DET2021 %>% mutate(year = 2021),
  DET2022 %>% mutate(year = 2022),
  DET2023 %>% mutate(year = 2023)
)
DET2021 <- DET2021 %>%
  filter(Name != "Matthew Boyd")
DET2021 <- DET2021 %>%
  filter(Name != "Matthew Boyd*")
combined_data$Name <- iconv(combined_data$Name, from = "UTF-8", to = "ASCII//TRANSLIT")

average_ops <- combined_data %>%
  group_by(Name) %>%
  summarise(average_OPS = mean(OPS, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(average_OPS))

print(average_ops)

```
```{r}
combined_data <- bind_rows(
  DET2021 %>% mutate(Year = "2021"),
  DET2022 %>% mutate(Year = "2022"),
  DET2023 %>% mutate(Year = "2023")
)

average_ops <- combined_data %>%
  group_by(Name) %>%
  summarise(Avg_OPS = mean(OPS, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(-Avg_OPS) %>%
  slice_head(n = 2)

filtered_data <- combined_data %>%
  filter(Name %in% average_ops$Name)

ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = Name, y = OPS, fill = Year)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    title = "Top 2 Players by Average OPS (2021-2023)",
    x = "Player",
    y = "OPS",
    fill = "Year"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

Kerry Carpenter not only has the best current OPS, but the best average OPS. He would be the ideal candidate for endorsement.
